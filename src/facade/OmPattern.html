<h1>Facade pattern</h1>
The facade pattern (or fa√ßade pattern) is a software design pattern commonly used with object-oriented programming. The name is by analogy to an architectural facade.

A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library. A facade can:

make a software library easier to use, understand and test, since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks;
make the library more readable, for the same reason;
reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system;
wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API (as per task needs).
The Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class which contains a set of members required by client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.


<h1>Usage</h1>

A Facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.[1] Alternatively, an adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. A decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time.

<h1>Pattern Intent</h1>

Adapter	Converts one interface to another so that it matches what the client is expecting
Decorator	Dynamically adds responsibility to the interface by wrapping the original code
Facade	Provides a simplified interface
The facade pattern is typically used when:

a simple interface is required to access a complex system;
the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled;
need an entry point to each level of layered software; or
a system is very complex or difficult to understand.    </body>
