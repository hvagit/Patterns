        <h1>Filter pattern</h1>
Filter pattern or Criteria pattern is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects, using different criteria, chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern is combining multiple criteria to obtain single criteria.

        <h1>Implementation</h1>

We're going to create a Person object, Criteria interface and concrete classes implementing this interface to filter list of Person objects. CriteriaPatternDemo, our demo class uses Criteria objects to filter List of Person objects based on various criteria and their combinations.    </body>
